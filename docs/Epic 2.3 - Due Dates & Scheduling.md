### Epic 2.3 â€” Due Dates & Scheduling

- SwiftUI DatePicker in `TaskFormView` (date & time) with clear support
- Due chip on `TaskCard` with overdue styling (red) and accessibility labels
- Optional sorting by due date (incomplete first, earliest due first, nils last), persisted via `AppStorage("sortByDueDate")`
- Lightweight overdue computation and minute-based updates handled by the view model
- Local notifications for due reminders with user toggle in Settings
- Supabase schema already supports `due_at` (indexed in `idx_tasks_user_bucket`)

Usage
- Enable "Sort by Due Date" in the list header to order tasks by due time
- Toggle "Due date notifications" in Settings to receive alerts at the due time

Notes
- Notifications schedule on create/update and cancel on completion/delete/clear due date
- No schema changes required; delta sync continues to track `due_at`
