## Architecture Delivered

### Authentication Layer
```
Core/Auth/
├── SupabaseConfig.swift        # Centralized client, global OAuth redirect URL
├── AuthenticationService.swift # Main auth service (@MainActor)
└── KeychainService.swift       # Secure session storage
```

### Remote Data Layer
```
Data/Remote/
├── DTOs/                       # TaskDTO, LabelDTO, UserDTO
├── SupabaseTasksRepository.swift
└── SupabaseLabelsRepository.swift
```

### Sync Infrastructure
```
Core/Sync/SyncService.swift     # Bidirectional sync orchestrator
```

### Authentication UI
```
Features/Auth/Views/
├── SignInView.swift            # Apple + Google sign-in
└── LoadingView.swift           # Auth loading state
```

---

## Backend Schema & Security
- Tables: `users`, `tasks`, `labels`, `task_labels`, `time_buckets`
- Triggers: `touch_updated_at` for `updated_at` consistency
- User bootstrap: `handle_new_user()` trigger on `auth.users`
- RLS: Owner-only access via `auth.uid()` policies on all user tables
- Indexes: performance optimized for sync and filtering

---

## Implementation Details (For Engineers)
- Supabase client configured with `AuthClient.Configuration.redirectToURL`
- Apple SIWA: secure nonce flow (hashed nonce in Apple request; raw nonce to Supabase)
- Google OAuth: explicit `redirectTo` passed to `signInWithOAuth(.google)`
- Auth state: `authStateChanges` stream handled and mapped to UI state
- Sessions: `KeychainService` stores/restores access/refresh tokens
- Error handling: categorized logging and resilient state transitions

---

## Setup & Repeatability (For PMs and DevOps)
- Guide: `docs/Epic 0.2.1 - Setup Supabase Guide.md` with end-to-end steps
- Apple: Services ID + App ID, JWT generation, and callback URL configuration
- Google: Web OAuth credentials and authorized redirect URIs
- iOS: URL Scheme `com.rubentena.DailyManna` and callback `com.rubentena.DailyManna://auth-callback`

---

## Validation Performed
- Apple SIWA completes and user session appears in Supabase
- Google OAuth completes and returns to the app via custom scheme
- Sessions persist in Keychain and restore on launch
- RLS verified: users can only access their records

---

## Releases and Repository
- Tags:
  - `v0.2.0-apple-siwa` — Apple Sign-In working with Supabase
  - `v0.2.1-google-oauth` — Google OAuth working (redirect + docs)
- Repo: https://github.com/RubenMaldonado/DailyManna

---

## Final Status — Epic 0.2: COMPLETE ✅
All acceptance criteria are satisfied, authentication is robust and secure, and documentation ensures the setup is repeatable across environments. The system is ready for continued sync and feature epics.
