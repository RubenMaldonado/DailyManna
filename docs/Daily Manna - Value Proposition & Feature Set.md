## **Daily Manna: Value Proposition & Feature Set**

### **Core Value Proposition: "Structure Your Week, Focus Your Mind."**

Daily Manna is a personal task manager designed to bring clarity and intention to your week. Unlike complex project management tools, Daily Manna provides a simple, structured framework that reduces cognitive load and helps users focus on what's important right now. By organizing tasks into intuitive, fixed time horizons, the app guides users toward a balanced and achievable weekly plan, transforming overwhelming to-do lists into a clear path forward.1

### **Key Features & Capabilities**

#### **1\. Intentional Time Buckets**

This is the core organizational philosophy of Daily Manna. Instead of forcing users to create and manage their own complex project structures, the app provides five fixed, intuitive buckets for all tasks.

* **\#THIS WEEK:** For tasks that are the focus for the current week.  
* **\#WEEKEND:** A dedicated space for personal tasks and weekend plans.  
* **\#NEXT WEEK:** For planning and staging tasks for the upcoming week.  
* **\#NEXT MONTH:** A bucket for longer-term items that don't require immediate attention.  
* **\#ROUTINES:** A special section dedicated to recurring tasks and habit-building.2

**Value for the User:** This opinionated structure simplifies the decision-making process. Users don't have to wonder where a task should go; they simply decide *when* they want to address it. This provides instant organization and a clear overview of their commitments across different timeframes.

#### **2\. Effortless Task Capture**

The primary goal is to make adding tasks frictionless, allowing users to capture thoughts the moment they arise.3

* **Natural Language Processing:** Users can type due dates and recurrence patterns in plain language. For example, typing "Submit report every Friday" will automatically create a recurring task, and "Call plumber tomorrow at 10am" will schedule it accordingly.4  
* **Quick Add:** A universal input field allows users to quickly "brain dump" tasks without needing to navigate through menus, ensuring no idea is lost.3

**Value for the User:** This dramatically lowers the barrier to using the app consistently. By making task entry as fast as thought, Daily Manna becomes a trusted "second brain" for all of life's to-dos.3

#### **3\. Flexible Organization with Labels (Tags)**

While Time Buckets provide the primary structure, labels offer a powerful, secondary layer of organization that works across all buckets.

* **Cross-Cutting Categories:** Users can create and color-code labels like @work, @personal, @errands, or @urgent to tag any task, regardless of its time bucket.  
* **Powerful Filtering:** Users can create saved filters to view specific slices of their tasks, such as viewing all @work tasks in the \#THIS WEEK bucket or seeing all @errands across all timeframes.4

**Value for the User:** Labels provide the flexibility of a tagging system within a structured environment. This allows users to create personalized views that match their unique workflow without sacrificing the simplicity of the core time bucket system.

#### **4\. Detailed & Actionable Task Management**

Every task can hold the necessary context to ensure it's clear and actionable.

* **Sub-tasks:** Larger tasks can be broken down into smaller, manageable steps, making them less daunting and easier to start.4  
* **Rich-Text Descriptions:** The description field supports formatting like bolding and URLs, allowing users to add detailed notes, links to resources, and other important context directly within the task.  
* **Specific Due Dates:** While a task lives in a general time bucket (e.g., \#THIS WEEK), it can still have a specific due date and time for precise scheduling and reminders.7

**Value for the User:** This ensures that when it's time to work on a task, all the necessary information is in one place, reducing friction and the need to switch between different apps or documents.

#### **5\. Dedicated Routine & Habit Management**

The \#ROUTINES bucket is specifically designed to handle recurring tasks effectively.

* **Dynamic Recurrence:** The app uses a "pattern-based" recurrence model. Instead of cluttering the list with all future instances of a task, it stores a rule (e.g., "every Monday"). When a user completes a task, the app automatically generates the next instance with the new due date.2

**Value for the User:** This keeps the main task lists clean and focused on the present, while still reliably managing all of the user's important habits and recurring responsibilities.
