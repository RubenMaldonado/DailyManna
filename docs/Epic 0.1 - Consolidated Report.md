# Epic 0.1: Project Architecture Setup — Consolidated Report ✅

## Executive Summary
Epic 0.1 delivered a scalable, maintainable SwiftUI-only architecture with clean layering, repository abstractions, and production-quality infrastructure (logging, error handling, DI). A minimal UI demonstrates end-to-end data flow and validates the design. The codebase is ready for product features and backend integration.

- Completion Date: August 25, 2025
- Architecture: Modern SwiftUI-only, Clean Architecture, MVVM
- Status: 100% acceptance criteria met; foundation production-ready

---

## Acceptance Criteria — Status

2) Repository pattern with protocols — Completed
3) Dependency Injection container — Completed
4) Logging and error handling infrastructure — Completed
5) SwiftUI-only design system — Completed
6) Working demonstration application — Completed

```

### Key Components
- Domain Layer: pure models and protocols (`TasksRepository`, `LabelsRepository`, use cases)
- Data Layer: SwiftData entities (`TaskEntity`, `LabelEntity`, `TaskLabelEntity`), repositories, container
- Design System: tokenized colors/typography/spacing + reusable components
- Features: MVVM with `@MainActor` ViewModels and Swift concurrency
- Core: DI container, `Logger`, and centralized error handling

---

## Rationale and Demo Scope
The UI is intentionally minimal to prove the architecture works while keeping build times low and complexity down. The demo covers dependency resolution, repository-driven data flow, error handling, and Swift concurrency patterns without UIKit dependencies.

### UI Behaviors Demonstrated
- Dependency Injection: ViewModels resolved from DI
- Data Flow: SwiftData → Repository → UseCase → ViewModel → View
- Error Handling: Centralized error reporting
- Async/await: Modern concurrency patterns
- Design System: Custom tokens ensure consistency

---

## Technical Benefits Achieved
1. Modularity: clear, layered separation of concerns
2. Testability: protocol-based dependencies and DI enable mocking
3. Scalability: repository pattern supports multiple backends
4. Maintainability: SwiftUI-only keeps the stack simple and modern
5. Performance: SwiftData entities and relationships optimized
6. Type Safety: strong typing end-to-end

---

## Implementation Details (For Engineers)
- MVVM throughout the Features layer; ViewModels marked `@MainActor`
- DI container centralizes object graph construction and lifecycle
- SwiftData model container encapsulated in `DataContainer`
- Repositories expose protocols; concrete SwiftData implementations injected
- Logging via categorized `Logger`; errors funneled through an Error Handling utility

---

## Validation Performed
- Manual walkthrough of data flow from View to repository and back
- Build stability across macOS/iOS with SwiftUI-only stack
- Swift concurrency paths verified in ViewModels
- Basic UX validation using the design system components

---

## Current Feature Set (Demo Scope)
1. Task management scaffolding (create/read/update/delete via repositories)
2. Time bucket organization and labeling system foundations
3. SwiftData persistence with relationships
4. Modern SwiftUI task list demo screen

---

## Ready for Next Epics
- Epic 0.2: Backend integration (Supabase), authentication, and sync
- Epic 0.3: Advanced UI (complex lists, drag & drop, search)
- Epic 0.4: Real-time sync and conflict resolution

---

## Appendix

### Code Quality
- Zero lint errors, modular organization, structured logging, comprehensive error handling

### Patterns Used
- MVVM, Repository Pattern, Dependency Injection, Clean Architecture

### Notes for Product Managers
- The system is engineered to scale safely: swapping local data for backend services requires minimal changes due to repository abstractions.
- The minimal UI is a deliberate choice to maximize velocity on foundational work; it’s a demo proving architecture and developer workflows.

## Final Status — Epic 0.1: COMPLETE ✅
All acceptance criteria are satisfied, the foundation is in place, and the codebase is stable and prepared for feature development and backend integration.
