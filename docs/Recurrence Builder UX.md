### Recurrence Builder UX

This view standardizes creating templates with full-calendar recurrence.

- Basics: name, description, priority, default time.
- Frequency: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly with an interval stepper.
  - Weekly: select one or more weekdays (chips).
  - Monthly: pick either a specific day (1–31) or an nth weekday (1st/2nd/3rd/4th/Last).
  - Yearly: choose month + day or nth weekday of the month.
- Range: start date; ends Never, On date, or After N occurrences.
- Preview: natural-language summary and next 10 occurrences update live.

Notes
- Keyboard: ⌘↩ (or Return on macOS) saves; ⎋ cancels.
- Accessibility: summary mirrors all selections; controls support VoiceOver.
- Timezone: uses system timezone for preview and default time semantics.
