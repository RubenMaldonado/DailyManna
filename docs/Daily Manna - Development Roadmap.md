# Daily Manna - Development Roadmap & Epic Prioritization

## Overview

This document outlines a prioritized, iterative development approach for Daily Manna, focusing on delivering value incrementally while building a robust foundation for future enhancements. The roadmap is structured around epics that can be developed, tested, and released independently, following the principle of "working software over comprehensive documentation."

## Development Philosophy

**Iterative Approach**: Start simple, validate early, iterate quickly
- **Phase 0**: Foundation & Infrastructure
- **Phase 1**: Core MVP with Essential Features
